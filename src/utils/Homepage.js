But the independence of Bangladesh is not achieved overnight. Once this territory had, been a colony of Great Britain for about 190 years. It had again been trapped by the Pakistanis. The Pakistanis had exploited Bangladesh for about 25 years. Bengalees had become crippled economically, physically and mentally by the ill treatment of the Pakistanis. However, we achieved our independence from the despotic and oppressive Pakistani occupation forces through a bloody war of nine months. It was achieved at the cost of a sea of ​​blood, and loss of chastity of our mothers and daughters. Our countrymen had to undergo a tremendously oppressive time during the war.",
